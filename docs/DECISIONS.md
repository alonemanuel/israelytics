# Decisions

An append-only log of decisions made building Israelytics, and *why*. Newest entries at
the bottom. Add an entry whenever you make a choice whose rationale isn't obvious from
the code. Format: **what** / **why** / **rejected**.

---

### 2026-05-29 — Stack: Next.js (App Router, TypeScript) on Vercel
**What:** Build the site as a Next.js app deployed on Vercel.
**Why:** User preference; one-click/`git push` deploys; room to grow into a real platform.
**Rejected:** Static no-build site (simplest, but less room to grow); Vite + vanilla
(build step without the framework benefits).

### 2026-05-29 — Data model: timeline-always
**What:** Every dataset is city × timeline. A single snapshot is a timeline of length 1
and the slider hides itself.
**Why:** One code path for both cases; the first dataset (elections) is naturally a timeline.
**Rejected:** Separate "snapshot" vs "timeline" modes — more code for little gain.

### 2026-05-29 — Separate base map from datasets
**What:** A shared `geo.json` holds geometry; each dataset holds only values per city per
time-step; the frontend joins them by city key.
**Why:** Makes the platform generic — a new dataset is a JSON file, not new code. Geometry
is heavy and shared, so it shouldn't be duplicated per dataset.
**Rejected:** Bundling geometry into each dataset (simpler to load, but duplicated and
couples data to the map).

### 2026-05-29 — Join key: normalized Hebrew city name
**What:** Cities are keyed by their normalized Hebrew name (e.g. `"בני ברק"`), resolved
through `pipeline/common/geo_index.resolve`.
**Why:** Human-readable; datasets don't need to carry an extra code column; matches how
the source data already identifies cities.
**Rejected:** Numeric `סמל ישוב` (CBS code) — more robust against spelling variants, but
every dataset would have to carry it and it's opaque. Revisit if name collisions bite.

### 2026-05-29 — Generic `colorScale` metadata per dataset
**What:** Each dataset declares `{type: sequential|diverging, scheme, domain, power?, midpoint?}`.
**Why:** Lets future datasets (counts, percentages, diverging measures) render correctly
without changing frontend code.
**Rejected:** Hard-coding the color logic in the frontend (would need edits per dataset).

### 2026-05-29 — `weight` for dot size lives in `geo.json`
**What:** Each city carries a dataset-independent `weight` (≈ electorate size) used for dot radius.
**Why:** Dot size should be consistent across datasets; it's a property of the place, not the data.
**Rejected:** Per-dataset sizing (inconsistent dot sizes when switching datasets).

### 2026-05-29 — Haredi defined as Shas (שס) + UTJ (ג)
**What:** The first dataset counts the two Haredi party ballot letters, `{שס, ג}`, as a
fraction of valid votes; configurable in the builder.
**Why:** Standard proxy for the Haredi vote. Both letters are stable across elections 19–25.
**Note:** Shas voters include some traditional (non-Haredi) Mizrahi voters, so this
slightly over-counts — accepted as the conventional measure.

### 2026-05-29 — Planar projection (geoIdentity), not Mercator
**What:** Render with `d3.geoIdentity` (planar) plus a longitude×cos(latitude) aspect
correction, rather than a spherical projection like Mercator.
**Why:** The source municipality polygons have inconsistent ring winding. Under a
spherical projection D3 interprets a wrongly-wound ring as "the whole globe except this
area," rendering the map inside-out and collapsing the fit. Planar projection is immune.
**Rejected:** Mercator with ring-rewinding — attempted, but winding was inconsistent across
features and fragile; planar sidesteps the problem entirely.

### 2026-05-29 — Filter foreign mis-geocodes by Israel bounding box
**What:** Coordinates outside an Israel bounding box are dropped during the geo build.
**Why:** The coordinate source mis-geocodes some names that collide with foreign places
(e.g. Hebron → Illinois, Uman → Ukraine), which otherwise break the map's auto-fit.

### 2026-05-29 — Geo universe = cities in the election files; weight = eligible voters
**What:** `geo.json` contains exactly the localities that appear in the election CSVs
(resolved to geometry), and each city's `weight` is its max eligible voters (בזב) across
elections.
**Why:** The election files are the most complete per-city list of Israel with a size
measure. A dataset-independent size proxy has to come from somewhere; eligible voters is
the best signal available.
**Rejected:** Including every polygon/coordinate city (bloats the base map with places no
dataset covers). **Future option:** expand the universe if a dataset needs a city absent
from the election files.

### 2026-05-29 — D3 owns the SVG inside React via refs
**What:** `MapView` keeps the D3 selection/projection/zoom in refs. One effect (keyed on
geo) draws geometry + wires zoom once; a second effect (keyed on dataset/timestep) only
recolors. React owns the picker/slider/legend.
**Why:** Zoom/pan state must survive re-renders, and redrawing 1,200 shapes on every
slider tick is wasteful. Separating "draw once" from "recolor" keeps interaction smooth.
**Rejected:** Rendering every SVG element as React nodes (clean, but fights D3's zoom and
re-renders the whole map on each timestep).

### 2026-05-29 — Generic color schemes via an interpolator registry
**What:** `lib/colorScale.ts` maps a dataset's `scheme` string to a d3 interpolator from a
small registry, supporting sequential (with optional `power`) and diverging (with
`midpoint`).
**Why:** New datasets pick a color treatment by name in their JSON; no frontend changes.
**Rejected:** Importing all of d3-scale-chromatic dynamically (unnecessary; a curated
registry is clearer and smaller).

### 2026-05-29 — Join key: CBS locality code (סמל יישוב), not Hebrew name
**What:** Switch the city join key from normalized Hebrew names to CBS locality codes —
stable numeric identifiers from the Israeli Central Bureau of Statistics.
**Why:** Hebrew names are fragile: encoding issues, normalization edge cases (dashes,
geresh, parentheticals), renaming (נצרת עילית → נוף הגליל). CBS codes are
language-independent, unambiguous, and stable across data sources.
**Rejected (previously):** Normalized Hebrew name — was the original choice for
human-readability, but fragility outweighed that benefit. Hebrew names are kept as
display labels (`nameHe` in geo.json).
**Migration:** `geo_index.py` still resolves names internally; builders call
`register_cbs_codes()` then `cbs_code_for()` to get the CBS code for output.

### 2026-05-29 — Object-keyed timesteps, not positional arrays
**What:** City values in datasets changed from positional arrays aligned to the timesteps
list (`[0.85, 0.83, null]`) to objects keyed by timestep ID (`{"k19": 0.85, "k20": 0.83}`).
**Why:** Positional arrays are fragile — one off-by-one and every value shifts silently.
Objects are self-documenting, sparse-safe (missing key = no data, no nulls needed), and
support datasets with irregular timelines (elections happen at uneven intervals).
**Rejected:** Positional arrays — more compact, but the ~250 cities × <30 timesteps
means the size difference is negligible. Safety and debuggability win.

### 2026-05-29 — Each dataset defines its own timeline
**What:** Timestep IDs are dataset-specific strings, not a global time axis. Election
datasets use `"k19"`, `"k20"`, etc. Year-based datasets use `"2020"`, `"2021"`, etc.
**Why:** Different data sources have fundamentally different time axes — elections are
irregular (sometimes 1 year apart, sometimes 4), while population data is annual. A
single shared timeline would force awkward alignment. The slider just steps through
whatever timesteps the dataset declares, so the frontend doesn't care.
**Rejected:** A single global year axis — would require interpolation or many nulls for
irregular data like elections.

## D-009 — UI redesign: full-bleed map, vertical timeline, auto light/dark

The map is now the canvas: it fills the viewport and the controls (top bar, dataset
picker, timeline, legend, zoom) float over it as translucent "glass" cards. This is a
mobile-first, map-app layout rather than a stacked dashboard.

Decisions:
- **Vertical timeline** docked to the (RTL) right edge, custom-built (not a native
  `<input type=range>`): newest timestep on top, large touch thumb, per-timestep ticks,
  a floating label, plus drag / tap-tick / arrow-key control. A native vertical range is
  inconsistent across browsers and has a tiny touch target.
- **Auto light/dark** via `prefers-color-scheme` and CSS custom properties (design
  tokens), so the app respects the device setting. `viewport.themeColor` follows suit.
- **Accent = Israeli blue**, kept distinct from the per-dataset map color schemes so UI
  chrome never competes with the data.
- **Heebo** webfont via `next/font` (self-hosted, no layout shift) for a branded Hebrew +
  Latin face instead of system fonts.
- **Tap-to-inspect**: tapping a city pins its tooltip and highlights it, since hover does
  not exist on touch. Tapping empty map clears it.

`NO_DATA_COLOR` moved from `#555` to a mid-slate (`#94a0b3`) that reads on both themes.

Rejected: a CSS framework (Tailwind). The surface area is small; plain CSS with tokens
keeps the dependency footprint minimal and the pure-view boundary intact.

### 2026-05-29 — CBS statistical areas as polygon source (replacing municipalities.geojson)
**What:** Replaced the ~250-feature `municipalities.geojson` (municipalities + local
councils + regional councils) with the CBS "Statistical Areas with Demographic Data"
geodatabase, dissolved by `SEMEL_YISHUV` to produce `localities.geojson` (1,387
per-locality polygons). Coverage went from 190 polygons to 1,190 out of 1,212 cities.
**Why:** The old source only had jurisdictional boundaries — municipalities and
regional councils. Small settlements (kibbutzim, moshavim, community settlements,
Bedouin towns) within regional councils had no polygon and were shown as dots. The CBS
source has a polygon for every recognized locality because each is at least one
statistical area.
**Rejected:** Voronoi tessellation from point coordinates (synthetic, not real
boundaries), buffer circles (still not real boundaries), keeping dots (poor UX).
**Caveats:** The CBS source uses 2011 statistical area boundaries. ~30 unrecognized
Bedouin settlements have no CBS polygon and fall back to point coordinates from
coords.csv. Geometry is simplified (tolerance 0.0005°, ~50m) to keep file size
manageable (~2.3 MB source, ~1 MB output).

### 2026-05-29 — Simplified GeoIndex: CBS code as primary key
**What:** Rewrote `geo_index.py` to look up geometry by CBS code directly via
`lookup(cbs_code)`, instead of the old name-normalization + alias resolution path.
**Why:** With CBS codes as the join key and CBS polygons as the geometry source, name
matching is no longer needed for the core join. The old approach (normalize Hebrew name
→ tight_key → alias → polygon lookup) was the most fragile part of the pipeline.
CBS code lookup is O(1) with zero ambiguity.
**Kept:** `normalize.py` and `coords.csv` for the point fallback (the ~30 unrecognized
settlements that need name-based coordinate lookup).
**Removed:** `aliases.csv` dependency for polygon matching, `register_cbs_codes()`,
`cbs_code_for()`, `resolve()`.

### 2026-05-29 — Datasets are self-contained provenance packages
**What:** Reorganized `pipeline/` so each dataset (and the basemap) is a folder
holding its raw downloaded files (`sources/`, committed as-is), a `SOURCE.md`
(where the raw came from + how it became numbers + caveats), and its `build.py`.
A `_TEMPLATE/` is the copy-to-start skeleton.
**Why:** A folder of final numbers is hard to reverse-engineer. Keeping the raw,
the source links, and the method beside the output makes every dataset reproducible
and auditable a year later — the whole motivation.
**Rejected:** A machine-readable `manifest.json` + sha256 `verify.py` — deferred as
YAGNI. The raw files are committed to git, so git already provides versioning and
tamper-detection; a `SOURCE.md` sources-table covers the human need. Add the manifest
later if automated re-fetching or cross-dataset tooling actually appears.
**Decided:** commit raw into the repo (self-contained, survives dead links);
provenance is repo-only for now (no UI changes).

### 2026-05-29 — Extend Haredi dataset back to 2006/2009 from ballot-box sources
**What:** Added the 17th (2006) and 18th (2009) Knessets to `haredi-vote`, so the
timeline is now 17–25 (nine elections). Their only available sources are
**per-ballot-box** (17th = a legacy `.xls`; 18th = a CSV), so the builder
aggregates ballot boxes up to the locality before computing the share.
**Why:** More history makes the "how the Haredi vote changed" story far stronger,
and the data exists.
**How:** The 18th carries a CBS code, so it groups by code directly. The 17th has
only city names, so codes are backfilled via `build_name_to_cbs` (the name↔code
pairs in the 19–25 per-locality files). ~96 of ~1,210 2006 localities don't resolve
(tiny/renamed places) and are omitted; reported, not silent.
**Validation:** National Haredi share computes to 14.5% (2006) and 13.0% (2009),
matching published Shas+UTJ results; per-city spot checks (Bnei Brak 0.80→0.90,
Modiin Illit ~0.97, Tel Aviv 0.09→0.05) are correct.
**Note:** Adds an `xlrd` dependency (only path that reads legacy `.xls`); recorded
in `pipeline/requirements.txt`.

### 2026-06-01 — Map redesign: national outline, neutral theme, screen-space labels
**What:** A visual overhaul of the map view. Four notable decisions below.

**National outline (`border.json`).** Added a filled country silhouette so land
reads as clearly separated from sea. Built by `build_border.py` as the **union** of
(a) an Israel outline + (b) a West Bank outline (both from
github.com/georgique/world-geojson, committed under `basemap/sources/border-src/`)
+ (c) the dissolved city polygons and a convex hull of the easternmost cities.
**Why this and not a single downloaded border:** the data includes Golan and eastern
localities that any one political outline omits, so a recognised-Israel border alone
left ~28 cities outside the line. Unioning with the data guarantees the outline
contains **every** city (verified 0 outside) and sidesteps picking a contested
boundary — it is "the extent of what we render."
**Rejected:** (1) dissolving only the city polygons — they are non-contiguous
(scattered municipal areas), so the union was a 25-piece archipelago, not a country.
(2) Adopting a tile/vector map provider (MapLibre) for the border + labels — would
require fixing CBS polygon winding for Mercator, a tile-provider API key, and a
`MapView` rewrite, for a basemap mostly hidden under the choropleth. Deferred.

**Theme.** Replaced the blue-tinted palette + auto-only dark mode with a neutral
(warm-paper / graphite) palette and an explicit light/dark **toggle** persisted in
localStorage, applied pre-paint by an inline script in `layout.tsx` to avoid a flash.
The no-data color became a CSS var (`--map-empty`) so it follows the theme.
**Why:** the blue cast fought the data colors; users want to choose, and the choice
must survive reloads.

**City labels in screen space.** Labels are an HTML overlay positioned in real px by
projecting centroids through the live zoom transform, with weight-priority collision.
**Why:** the first attempt rendered SVG text inside the zoomed `<g>` sized at
`12/k` units — tiny on mobile (canvas-relative, not screen) and kerning broke at high
zoom (sub-pixel font scaled up). Screen-space text is crisp at every zoom, on every
device, with no new dependency.

**Pinned tooltip follows its city.** A pinned (clicked) tooltip is re-anchored to its
city centroid on every zoom/pan (and hidden when the city scrolls off-stage), instead
of staying frozen at the original click pixel.

### 2026-06-01 — Promote the election results to a shared source package
**What:** Moved the raw Knesset CSVs out of `datasets/haredi-vote/sources/` into a
new top-level `pipeline/elections/` provenance package (its own `SOURCE.md`). All
consumers — `basemap/build_geo.py` and every election-derived dataset — now read
them via `elections.SOURCES_DIR`. Introduced the idea that **one source feeds many
datasets**; a dataset is a *reduction* of a source, not necessarily the owner of raw.
**Why:** The results were never really "the haredi dataset's data" — the basemap
already reached into that folder (a documented cross-dependency), and adding a
right-vs-left map gave a third consumer of the identical raw. Filing shared raw
under one arbitrary dataset is a smell that gets worse with each new consumer.
**Rejected:** (a) *Piggyback* — point the new builder at `../haredi-vote/sources`.
Zero migration but doubles down on the mis-filing; two outsiders reaching into one
dataset. (b) Put the raw in `pipeline/sources/` — that path is gitignored, and
shared raw must be committed for provenance, so it would have been invisible.
**Note:** `git mv` preserved history; the basemap's cross-dependency note and
CLAUDE.md were updated to point at the shared package.

### 2026-06-01 — Right-vs-Left dataset: signed margin, two-bloc, per-election table
**What:** Added `right-left-vote` — value = `(R − L)/(R + L)` in [−1,+1], rendered
with a diverging RdBu scale (red=left, blue=right, white=even). Parties are split
into exactly two blocs (no center bucket) via a **per-election** letter→party→bloc
table (`elections.PARTIES`), with center and Arab parties counted as **Left**.
**Why:** A signed margin reads naturally as a red↔blue political map and reuses the
already-generic diverging colorScale (no frontend change). The table *must* be
per-election because ballot letters are reused by different parties across years
(`כן`=Kadima→National Unity; `ב`=Jewish Home→Yamina; `ט`=National Union→Religious
Zionism) — a global letter map would be silently wrong. Two-bloc + center/Arab→Left
were explicit user choices, documented as editorial in the dataset's SOURCE.md.
**Validation:** National margins match the historical record — 2006 = −0.167 (the
real 50R/70L seat split), flipping right from 2009 on; coverage 95–99% of valid votes.
**Rejected:** Right-share-of-(R+L) as a 0..1 value (less intuitive than a signed
axis); a three-bloc scheme with a neutral center (user chose two-bloc); a single
global party table (wrong, per above).

### 2026-06-01 — Generic per-cell breakdown (`{v, parts}`) + per-dataset `infoHe`
**What:** Two extensions so a dataset can say more than one number. (1) A cell may be
`{v, parts:[{labelHe,value,tag?}]}` instead of a bare number — `v` still drives the
color; `parts` is an optional breakdown shown in the tooltip (right-left fills the
top-6 parties + "אחר", tagged R/L). (2) A dataset may carry `infoHe`, markdown-lite
methodology shown behind an ⓘ button. Both are optional and dataset-agnostic; the
frontend reads cells through `cellValue()`/`cellParts()` and changes nothing else.
**Why:** "Right vs Left = −0.38" is opaque on its own — users want to know *how* a
city voted and *what the blocs mean*. Keeping the channels generic (`parts`/`tag`
are not party-specific; `info` is just markdown) means future non-election datasets
reuse them for free, preserving the "new dataset = new JSON, not new code" property.
**Rejected:** A separate lazy-loaded `<id>.details.json` sidecar (kept inline —
right-left is ~400 KB gzipped, a non-issue at one-country scale, and avoids a second
fetch + loading state); rendering the dev-facing `SOURCE.md` as the info panel (too
long/English/technical for end users — `infoHe` is a curated reader-facing blurb);
hardcoding a party-breakdown type (would not generalize to other datasets).
**Note:** `infoHe` panel is portaled to `<body>` — the header's `backdrop-filter`
(`.glass`) is a containing block that otherwise traps `position:fixed` children.

### 2026-06-01 — Editorial, type-led visual refresh (masthead = picker)
**What:** Reworked the frontend styling toward an editorial type-foundry aesthetic
(reference: Hagilda, Fontef). Three moves: (1) the dataset `<select>` is now styled
*as* the serif headline — big Hadassah display, transparent/borderless, slim chevron
— so the page's typographic hero and its dataset picker are one element; above it a
tracked-out uppercase Latin eyebrow ("Israelytics") with the serif "י" mark, below it
the `descriptionHe` teaser. (2) Surfaces went from heavy frosted glass (16px blur,
big shadows, pill chrome) to **flat paper**: ~0.86 opacity, 11px blur, light shadows,
smaller radii, hairline (`--hairline`) dividers. (3) The masthead **hugs its content**
at the top-start corner (was a full-width bar), and the theme toggle floats free in the
opposite corner. Added type tokens (`--text-2xl/3xl` enlarged, `--track-tight/-wide`,
`--faint`) and tabular figures on all numeric UI.
**Why:** The old look was generic glassmorphism-dashboard; the brief was "beautiful,
minimalistic, typography-focused." Making the dataset title the display face (a) gives
the page a real headline, (b) removes the title/dropdown duplication, and (c) leans on
the two Hebrew typefaces already loaded. Flattening the chrome lets the map's data
colours carry the visual weight (the neutral-first rule) instead of competing with
frosted panels. Only `app/globals.css` + `app/page.tsx` changed — components were
restyled via existing class names, no logic touched.
**Rejected:** A full-width masthead bar (left a large empty expanse with content
clustered to the RTL start; the hugging card reads as intentional). A custom dropdown
component (the native `<select>` styles fine as display text and keeps a11y/mobile for
free). Changing the accent away from terracotta (it's warm and restrained; kept, used
more sparingly).
